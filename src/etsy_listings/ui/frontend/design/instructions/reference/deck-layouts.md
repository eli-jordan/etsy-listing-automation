# Deck layouts - the atlas, the grid, the budgets

Required reading at step 4 of every deck. The doctrine's recipe list is the core;
this is the full atlas grouped by the JOB a slide does, the shared stage and the
optional banded grid recipes draw from, and the content budgets that keep type at design size. The atlas
is a vocabulary, not a fence: when nothing fits the concept you wrote for the
slide, compose it from divs.

Words used below: **kicker** = the small-caps `sl-caption` label above a title;
**hero** = a card's one-line headline in `sl-support`; **ghost numeral** = a large,
low-contrast number behind or beside a card that carries order; **display** =
`sl-display`, the one oversize role; **stat** = `sl-stat`, the row-of-figures size.

## The stage and the banded grid (content box 1104×632px)

Stage margins are asymmetric: 88px at the sides, 44px top and bottom, in px
at every viewport. Every silhouette shares those margins and nothing else.
The BANDED grid below is the shell for grid and split recipes that carry a
title band; statements, heroes, fields, and bookends build their own
geometry inside the same margins. (The doctrine's 85% rule and spacing scale
govern every silhouette.)

- **Title band** - the top ~113px: kicker (18px, one line) over the assertion
  (56px, one line), a hairline under. Within a visual group it sits in the
  same place on each slide, so a travelling title lands where it left.
- **Body band** - full width, ~438px, starting 48px below the title block.
  Content fills at most ~372px of it. This band is the slide.
- **Foot** - the source line (25px), 48px under the body. A takeaway bar sits
  between them: 56px tall, 40px clear above it.
- **Split** - text left at 43% of the width, visual right at 48%, a 9% gutter.
  Argument reads first, proof confirms it. A `sl-assertion` in a 43% column
  holds ~20 characters a line - write to it.
- **Columns** - three equal at a 32px gap (~347px each); five narrow (~192px)
  for spectrums; a 2×2 when the four cells are peers. Card padding 32px.
- **Dominance before containers.** Decide what is biggest on the slide before
  choosing what holds the rest. Whitespace that makes the dominant object read
  as dominant needs no defence; a companion panel added to "fill the other
  half" does - if it is not evidence, leave the half empty.

The banded skeleton, in the project's own Tailwind - for the grid and split
slides that carry a title band, and only those:

```tsx
<Slide>
  {/* one child at flex:1 claims the box, so the bands land in the same
      place across a visual group; gap 48 is the title-to-body / body-to-foot step */}
  <div className="flex-1 min-h-0 flex flex-col gap-12">
    <header className="shrink-0">
      <p className="sl-caption uppercase tracking-[.14em]">Retention</p>
      <h1 className="sl-assertion mt-2">Churn halved after onboarding v2</h1>
      <hr className="mt-5 border-0 h-px bg-black/10" />
    </header>
    <div className="flex-1 min-h-0 grid grid-cols-[43fr_9fr_48fr] items-center gap-8">
      <div className="sl-body space-y-6">…argument…</div>
      <div />
      <Chart option={…} />
    </div>
    <footer className="sl-caption shrink-0">Source: product analytics, Aug 2026</footer>
  </div>
</Slide>
```

## The atlas (when · skeleton · budget · anchor)

A recipe without a named anchor does not morph - hard cut. Anchors are named
only inside a declared visual group or build; never a deck-wide fallback.
Budgets are heuristics: the rendered 1280×720 frame and the Slide's overflow
outline are the authority - when they disagree with a number here, the frame
wins. And a slide that merely FITS is not done: the 85% rule is the bar.

**Parallel points**

- **cards** - 2-6 equal cards (kicker · hero · body), ghost numerals for order,
  at most ONE accented card for the emphasised option. Budget: 2-3 cards carry a
  body (≤120 chars, 3 lines); 4-6 cards are kicker + hero only. Anchor: the row.
- **spectrum** - 3-7 narrow cards for a progression or maturity model, low to
  high left to right. Budget: kicker ≤8 chars, hero ≤15, body ≤40 (≤5 cards) or
  none (6-7).
- **columns** - N headers + descriptions + an optional metric strip beneath:
  product lines, tracks, team areas. Budget: ≤4 columns with bodies, ≤6 without.
- **stacked list** - 4-6 items in the right field, argument on the left; the
  numbered variant carries ghost numerals for ordered reasons. Budget: item ≤2
  lines at 24px. Anchor: the list.
- **split** - argument left (1-3 short paragraphs, optional `sl-support`
  sub-head), ONE visual right (metric, card, image, chart). The workhorse of
  analytical slides. Anchor: the visual.
- **insight + evidence** - one large insight left (≤30 words, `sl-support`),
  3-4 evidence items right (one-line title + one line). Anchor: the insight.

**Proof**

- **metric** - one hero number (`sl-display`) with label + sub-line, enclosed
  only when the boundary means something;
  pair with a split or a stat row. Budget: value ≤8 chars, label ≤20, sub ≤30.
- **stat row** - 3-4 figures across in `sl-stat` with a label under each.
  Budget: value ≤7 chars at 3 across, ≤5 at 4; label ≤4 words. Anchor: the row.
- **trajectory** - stacked from → to pairs with a label ("$100k → $480k MRR").
  Budget: 3-4 pairs. Anchor: the arrows.
- **table** - header row with a rule under it, zebra rows, numbers right-aligned,
  units in the header. Budget at 24px: ≤5 columns × ≤6 rows, header ≤15 chars,
  cell ≤14; more than that is two slides or a chart.
- **mini grid** - N×M small value + label cells with hairline dividers, for a
  dashboard glance. Budget: ≤12 cells (4×3).
- **takeaway bar** (modifier) - a full-width dark bar at the foot with the
  so-what, centred, no trailing full stop, ≤12 words. Never a paraphrase of the
  assertion - a different angle or nothing.

**Contrast**

- **before / after** - the doctrine's two-up, the "after" side accented.
- **scenarios** - bear / base / bull columns over a metric list, the recommended
  column highlighted. Budget: 3 scenarios × ≤5 metrics.

**Process** (the subject, never the provenance)

- **flow** - step cards with forward arrows; ≤5 steps keep bodies, 6+ drop to
  labels only. Budget: label ≤15 chars, body ≤40.
- **cycle** - 3-6 auto-numbered nodes around a centre; four nodes sit square at
  the corners, others on a circle. Budget: label ≤15, body ≤40. Anchor: the ring.
- **chain** - primary chevrons for the value chain with support bars beneath (the
  enabling activities). Budget: ≤6 chevrons, ≤3 bars.
- **swim lanes** - lanes (rows) × stages (columns) with mini-cards at the
  intersections: hand-offs, RACI, cross-functional flow. Budget: ≤4 lanes × ≤5
  columns, card ≤8 words.
- **funnel** - 3-8 narrowing tiers, the drop-off stated. Budget: label + one
  line ≤5 tiers; labels only at 6-8.

**Time**

- **schedule** - sections × time columns, task bars, milestone diamonds. Budget:
  ≤7 rows, ≤8 columns. Anchor: the time header.
- **timeline**, **roadmap phases** - the doctrine's; alternate event labels
  above and below the spine when they crowd.

**Structure and position**

- **layers** - full-width stacked layers with tag pills; the foundation layer
  dark. Budget: ≤5 layers, ≤4 tags each.
- **org** - boxes + connectors, two levels max; deeper goes to an appendix.
- **venn** - 2-3 circles with 2-3 items each and a named overlap.
- **concentric** - TAM / SAM / SOM rings, labels inside the rings, legend right.
- **pyramid** - 3-6 trapezoid tiers, widest at the top, each tier a label + 1-3
  items. For priority, never for volume (that is the funnel).
- **number line** - ticks with labels, one highlighted range: pricing tiers, a
  valuation range, benchmarks. Budget: ≤6 ticks.
- **capability matrix** - competitors × capabilities with empty / half / full
  circles (CSS), us in the first column. Budget: ≤6 × ≤7.

**Status**

- **scorecard** - rows with a red / amber / green dot + a one-line note. ≤7 rows.
- **heat map** - rows × columns of RAG cells, a legend, no numbers inside cells.
  Budget: ≤6 × ≤6.
- **tracker** - initiative · owner · phase · next milestone; or decision · owner ·
  date · status. Budget: ≤6 rows, owners as initials badges.

**People and voice**

- **testimonials** - 1-6 quote cards with an initials avatar, name, company -
  attributed voices (the doctrine's quote-wall is unattributed fragments, ≤15
  words). Budget: ≤25 words a quote at ≤4 cards, ≤15 at 5-6. Anchor: the avatars.
- **team** - 1-8 people: initials, name (≤15 chars), role (≤22). Budget: ≤4
  people carry a bio (≤30 words); 5-8 are name + role.
- **manifesto** - a single large claim in `sl-support` or `sl-display`, one
  accent-coloured phrase, an attribution line. Budget: ≤20 words. Anchor: the
  accent phrase.

**Images**

- **framed source** - a screenshot, a chart from a PDF, a product shot: the real
  image on the right, framing text on the left saying what it shows. The bitmap
  is at least 2× the CSS box it renders in. Never redraw a source chart as a
  fake: rebuild it as a `Chart` when the underlying data is available, embed the
  render when it is not.

## Budgets that keep type at design size

| Element                      | Cap                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| card kicker · hero · body    | 20 · 30 · 120 chars (bodies only at ≤3 cards)           |
| narrow (spectrum) card       | 8 · 15 · 40 chars                                       |
| metric value · label · sub   | 8 · 20 · 30 chars                                       |
| table header · cell          | 15 · 14 chars, ≤5 × ≤6                                  |
| flow / cycle label · body    | 15 · 40 chars                                           |
| timeline date · title · body | 8 · 20 · 20 chars                                       |
| quote                        | 30 words; testimonial 25 (≤4) / 15 (5-6); quote-wall 15 |
| bio                          | 30 words at ≤4 people; name 15 chars, role 22           |
| takeaway bar                 | 12 words, one line                                      |
| body paragraphs              | 3-5 short paragraphs, ~600 chars total                  |

A breach is a different recipe or a split. Type never shrinks to fit - the review
gate reads shrunk type as the tell it is.

## Rebuilding an existing deck

When the human hands you a finished deck to rebuild on the canvas, ask which
mode - and default to faithful:

- **Faithful** - their order, their words, exactly. You may normalise
  punctuation (em dashes → commas or periods) and number formats; you may not
  change a word. Label titles stay labels. Suggested rewrites go in a comment on
  the frame, never on the slide.
- **Editorial** (opt-in) - order kept, copy passed through the doctrine's words
  rules: jargon, hedges, filler out; numbers, names, dates verbatim; titles
  turned into assertions where the source supports the claim.

Then map shapes - a companion visual ONLY where the source supplies it; a
paragraph with no metric, image, or chart behind it is a text-led composition,
and that whitespace is honest:

| Source shape                                                     | Layout                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a paragraph                                                      | split when the source has a companion (metric, image, chart); else text-led |
| 3 bullets                                                        | cards                                                                       |
| 4-6 bullets                                                      | stacked list (numbered if ordered)                                          |
| up to 4 numbers                                                  | metric grid or stat row                                                     |
| a quote                                                          | quote                                                                       |
| a table                                                          | table (or two slides past the budget)                                       |
| a chart with its data                                            | `Chart` from the data                                                       |
| an image, chart, schedule, diagram you cannot rebuild losslessly | framed source                                                               |

## Charts and diagrams - the extra mile

- **Decision flows**: boil choices to yes / no, quantify the branches (%, volumes)
  so the eye follows the path that matters, hang customer quotes on the node
  they support.
- **Waterfalls** beat tables for build-ups and breakdowns: left to right in the
  logical order, the one or two bars that matter highlighted, a few callouts that
  pre-empt the room's questions.
- **When a slide must be complex**: large visual cues (boxes, highlights) on the
  point, grouping and colour that steer interpretation, and the voiceover ON the
  page - the slide must make sense with no presenter.
- **Aggregate.** The chart is not the model. Single series is fine. Overlay
  detail (lines, shading) on the base chart instead of adding a second chart.
- **Formatting**: label bars directly and drop the value axis when the chart is
  simple (keep the axis for dense or grouped series); growth rates visible; one
  label size across the deck; series in logical order (base first, growth
  next); same hue = same thing on every slide; charts aligned to the grid and to
  each other across slides.
