# Discover - understand before you draw

Run this phase for any NEW surface, feature, or project. Skip it only when a brief
already answers everything below. Its output is a written brief; nothing gets designed
until the brief has a human nod. (One exception: the first-session draft
(welcome.md) skips the brief - the human just said what they are building.)

## 1. Read the repo, then interview

First inspect what exists: the app's screens, components, theme, copy, and any brief
or README - questions the repo answers are never asked. THEN ask at most five
questions, in one message; never CSS values or aesthetic lanes. Ask what changes the
work:

1. **Who** must this serve, and in what scene (device, ambient light, attention level)?
2. **The one job**: what should a visitor be able to decide, complete, understand, or
   feel? (One job. If you get three, ask which one wins.)
3. **The core flow**: entry → the moment of value → done. What are the 3-6 screens?
4. **What exists**: real content, brand assets, an app, competitors they respect,
   any screenshots or sites they LOVE? (A visual reference beats a paragraph of
   description - ask for one when the direction matters.)
5. **Out of scope**: what must NOT be touched or built?

## 2. Pick the mode - it drives every later decision

Name the surface's mode in the brief. The mode is the visitor's success:

- **Persuade** - the visitor decides and acts (landing, pricing, campaign). The offer
  and the action must be legible in the first viewport.
- **Operate** - the visitor completes a task (app UI, dashboard, settings). Scanability
  and native expectations outrank expression.
- **Read** - the visitor understands (docs, guides). Structure for comprehension.
- **Experience** - the visitor is inside the work (portfolio, gallery). The artifact
  leads; the interface recedes.

A tool's landing page is Persuade. A fashion house's docs are Read. The mode belongs
to the SURFACE, not the product.

## 3. Write the brief

Create `design/scenes/<scene>/_brief.md`: audience + scene, the one job, mode, the
flow as a numbered list, content sources, out-of-scope. Ten lines, not a document.
**Its first non-blank line is the scene's one-sentence description** - purpose and state,
e.g. `# Checkout - the buyer's path from cart to receipt (v2, after the pricing pivot)`.
That line lands in `design/manifest.json` as the scene's `description`, so a later
session reads it without opening the brief; keep it true as the scene moves on (a
scene that only needs a gist - a version snapshot, an archive - gets a one-line brief).
A scene's directory is its identity (every frame id starts with it); what humans SEE
for it is `title` in the brief's YAML front matter - optional, free text - the sidebar
Title-Cases the directory otherwise (`checkout` → "Checkout", but `mvp` → "Mvp"):

```md
---
title: "Checkout (v2)"
---

# Checkout - the buyer's path from cart to receipt (v2, after the pricing pivot)
```

The human's Rename on a scene writes exactly that line; leave the block alone and
never rename the directory for a title. Show the brief. Get the nod.

**Unattended?** When the human is away or has said "don't ask", the interview and
the nod convert to obligations, not blockers: answer the five questions yourself
from the repo and reasonable product judgment, mark the brief `UNCONFIRMED` in its
first line (`# Checkout - … (UNCONFIRMED)`), proceed - and surface the brief FIRST when the human returns. Never stall on
an absent human; never hide that the brief was self-answered.

## 4. Align on flow with a diagram frame

When the flow has branches or more than four screens, draw it before wireframing:
one content frame (`<scene>/flow.tsx`) with a mermaid `Diagram` block - the how lives
in instructions/shape.md. Each node names a future frame. The human can look at one
picture and say "step 3 is wrong" before step 3 costs anything.

Then move to Wireframe. Do not brand, do not pick type, do not open the craft rules
yet - those phases come after the flow and words are agreed.
